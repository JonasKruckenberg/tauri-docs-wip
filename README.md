Beware of typos, inaccuracies, mistakes, and missing pages!

## Reasoning

There are two main reasons for this extensive rewrite, with the first
being Coherency. The current documentation has grown organically and
therefore has a number of inconsistencies: Some concepts are assumed
to be self-explanatory or are introduced _after_ they are relevant.
This rewrite attempts to fix those issues by taking readers on a
"linear guided tour" first introducing important mental concepts
behind Tauri in `Background` and then stepping through the 3 relevant
life-stages of an application `Development` -> `Building` ->
`Distribution`. Concepts are introduced in order if possible. The docs
are rounded off by several examples showcasing common problems and
solutions. Examples focus on "show don't tell" and contain many code
examples + images instead of explanations. It is assumed the reader
knows enough about Tauri development to understand the examples on
their own.

The second big reason was style inconsistencies, different people have
written docs at different times, and it shows. Changes in narrative
perspective, different formatting, different writing styles etc. This
rewrite attempts to unify the documentation with a consistent writing
and text formatting style. I tried to not make arbitrary style choices
but give reasons for them as you can see in the style guide below:

## Style Guide

- **Use [Reference-style Links]**

  This makes reading the raw markdown and updating links easier as it
  doesn't break up the text flow as much as inline links.

- **Add Captions**

  Add captions to diagrams, images and code samples by using
  `<figure></figure>` and `<figcaption></figcaption>` if possible.
  This is good for accessibility and being able to refer to code
  samples. Small code snippets, like individual commands, that are
  explained through prose don't need captions, but larger code samples
  that we would refer people to should.

- **Format Code samples**

  Format code samples using [Prettier] or the [Rust Playground]. A
  consistent code formatting makes reading those samples less taxing
  for readers.

- **Use _You_ to address readers**

  We want to keep the docs light and easy to read, so we directly
  address the reader.

- **Use _We_ to refer to Tauri**

  We, a group of people, maintain Tauri, so we should refer to
  ourselves in-text as a group too.

- **Use present tense**

  This makes the text easier to comprehend. Make an exception for
  planned or obsolete features, using future or past tense as
  appropriate.

- **Use active voice**

  This makes the text more engaging and easier to comprehend.

- **Language Order**

  With code examples that are written in Rust and JavaScript, always
  order the code blocks `Rust > JavaScript`.

- **Correctly capitalize brands**

  Use the correct capitalization for brand names, such as Tauri
  instead of tauri, or macOS instead of Macos.

- **Use title case for titles**

  Use [title case] for titles and [sentence case] for prose.
