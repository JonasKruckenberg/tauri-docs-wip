# Security

Whether you like it or not, today's applications live in operating systems that
can be -- and regularly are -- compromised by any number of attacks. When your
insecure application is a gateway for such lateral movement into the operating
system, you are contributing to the tools that professional hackers have at
their disposal. Don't be a tool.

This is why we have taken every opportunity to help you secure your application,
prevent undesired access to system level interfaces, and manufacture
bullet-proof applications. Your users assume you are following best practices.
We make that easy, but you should still read up on it below.

## Security Is A Community Responsibility

It is important to remember that the security of your Tauri application is the
result of the overall security of Tauri itself, all Rust and NPM dependencies,
your code, and the devices that run the final application. The Tauri Team does
its best to do its part, the security community does its part, and you too would
do well to follow a few important best practices:

- **Keep your application up-to-date.** When releasing your app into the wild,
  you are also shipping a bundle that has Tauri in it. Vulnerabilities affecting
  Tauri may impact the security of your application. By updating Tauri to the
  latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities are already patched
  and cannot be exploited in your application. Also be sure to keep your
  compiler (rustc) and transpilers (nodejs) up to date, because there are often
  security issues that are resolved.

- **Evaluate your dependencies.** While NPM and Crates.io provide many
  convenient packages, it is your responsibility to choose trustworthy 3rd-party
  libraries - or rewrite them in Rust. If you do use outdated libraries affected
  by known vulnerabilities or are unmaintained, your application security and
  good-night's sleep could be in jeopardy. Use tooling like npm audit and cargo
  audit to automate this process and lean on the security community's important
  work.

- **Adopt more secure coding practices.** The first line of defense for your
  application is your own code. Although Tauri can protect you from common web
  vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting based Remote Code Execution,
  improper configurations can have a security impact. Even if this were not the
  case, it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best
  practices and perform security testing. We detail what this means in the next
  section.

- **Educate your Users.** True security really means that unexpected behaviour
  cannot happen. So in a sense, being more secure means having the peace of mind
  in knowing that ONLY those things that you want to happen can happen. In the
  real world, though, this is a utopian "dream". However, by removing as many
  vectors as possible and building on a solid foundation, your choice for Tauri
  is a signal to your users that you really care about them, their safety, and
  their devices.

## Threat Models

Tauri applications are composed of many pieces at different points of the
lifecycle. Here we describe classical threats and what you SHOULD do about them.

- **Upstream Threats.** Tauri is a direct dependency of your project, and we
  maintain strict authorial control of commits, reviews, pull requests, and
  releases. We do our best to maintain up-to-date dependencies and take action
  to either update or fork&fix. Other projects may not be so well maintained,
  and may not even have ever been audited. Please consider their health when
  integrating them, because otherwise you may have adopted architectural debt
  without even knowing it.

- **Development Threats.** We assume that you, the developer, care for your
  development environment like a shrine of purity because it is a thing of
  beauty. It is on you to make sure that your operating system, build
  toolchains, and associated dependencies are kept up to date.

  A genuine risk all of us face is what is known as "supply-chain attacks",
  which are usually considered to be attacks on direct dependencies of your
  project. However, a growing class of attacks in the wild directly target
  development machines, and you would be well-off to address this head-on. <br>
  One practice that we highly recommend, is to only ever consume critical
  dependencies from git using hash revisions at best or named tags as second
  best. This holds for Rust as well as the Node ecosystem. Also, consider
  requiring all contributors to sign their commits and protect GIT branches and
  pipelines.

- **Buildtime Threats.** Modern organisations use CI/CD to manufacture binary
  artifacts. At Tauri, we even provide a Github Workflow for building on
  multiple platforms. If you create your own CI/CD and depend on third-party
  tooling, be wary of actions whose versions you have not explicitly pinned.
  <br> You should sign your binaries for the platform you are shipping to, and
  while this can be complicated and somewhat costly to setup, end-users expect
  that your app is verifiably from you.

- **Runtime Threats.** We assume the webview is insecure, which has led Tauri to
  implement several protections regarding webview access to system APIs in the
  context of loading untrusted userland content. <br> You can read more in
  detail below, but using the CSP will lockdown types of communication that the
  Webview can undertake. Furthermore, [Context Isolation](#context-isolation)
  prevents untrusted content or scripts from accessing the API within the
  Webview. <br> And please, whatever you do, **DO NOT** trust the results of
  cryptography using private keys in the Webview. We gave you Rust for a reason.

- **Updater Threats.** We have done our best to make shipping hot-updates to the
  app as straightforward and secure as possible. However, all bets are off if
  you lose control of the manifest server, the build server, or the binary
  hosting service. If you build your own system, consult a professional OPS
  architect and build it properly.

## Secure content loading

Tauri restricts the [Content Security Policy] (CSP) of your HTML pages. Local
scripts are hashed, styles and external scripts are referenced using a
cryptographic nonce, which prevents unallowed content from being loaded.

> ❗️ Avoid loading remote content such as scripts served over a CDN as they
> introduce an attack vector, but any untrusted file can introduce new and
> subtle attack vectors.

The CSP protection is only enabled if [tauri > security > csp] is set on the
Tauri configuration file. You should make it as restricted as possible, only
allowing the webview to load assets from hosts you trust and preferably own. At
compile time, Tauri appends its nonces and hashes to the relevant CSP attributes
automatically, so you only need to worry about what is unique to your
application.

See [`script-src`], [`style-src`] and [CSP Sources] for more information about
this protection.
