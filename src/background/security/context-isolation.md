# Context Isolation

Context Isolation is a way to intercept and modify Tauri API messages sent by
the Frontend before they get to Tauri Core, all with JavaScript. The secure
JavaScript code that is injected by the Isolation pattern is referred to as the
Isolation application.

This is useful to validate, sanitize, and filter messages sent from the Frontend
before they even enter the Core's secure context.

## Why?

The Isolation pattern's purpose is to provide a mechanism for developers to help
protect their application from unwanted or malicious Frontend calls to Tauri
Core. The need for the Isolation pattern rose out of threats coming from
untrusted content running on the Frontend, a common case for applications with
many dependencies. See [Security: Threat Models] for a list of many sources of
threats that an application may see.

The largest threat model described above that the Isolation pattern was designed
in mind with was Development Threats. Not only do many Frontend build-time tools
consist of many dozen (or hundreds) of often deeply-nested dependencies, but a
complex application may also have a large amount of (also often deeply-nested)
dependencies that are bundled into the final output.

## When?

Tauri highly recommends using the isolation patten whenever it can be used.
Because the Isolation application intercepts _all_ messages from the Frontend,
it can _always_ be used.

We highly suggest that you lock down your application whenever you use external
Tauri APIs. As the developer, you can utilize the secure Isolation application
to verify IPC inputs to make sure they are within some expected parameters. For
example, you may want to check that a call to read or write a file is not trying
to get to a path outside your application's expected locations. <br> Another
example is making sure that a Tauri API HTTP fetch call is only setting the
Origin header to what your application expects it to be.

That said, it intercepts all messages from the Frontend, so it will even work
with always-on APIs such as [Events]. Since some events may cause your rust code
to perform actions, the same validation techniques can be used.

## How?

An Isolation Application is essentially just a JavaScript file that Tauri will
run in a locked-down, isolated environment. You assign a callback to the
`window.__TAURI_ISOLATION_HOOK__` global property that Tauri will invoke
whenever an IPC message is about to be sent.

Because the point of the Isolation application is to protect against Development
Threats, we highly recommend keeping your Isolation application as simple as
possible. <br> Fewer dependencies and build steps mean less risk of supply chain
attacks against your Isolation application.

### Creating the Isolation Application

We will make a small hello-world style Isolation application and hook it up to
an imaginary existing Tauri application. It will do no verification of the
messages passing through it, only print the contents to the WebView console.

For the purposes of this example, let's imagine we are in the same directory as
`tauri.conf.json`. The existing Tauri application has it's `distDir` set to
`../dist`.

Filename: index.html

<figure>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Isolation Secure Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</figure>

Filename: index.js

<figure>

```javascript
window.__TAURI_ISOLATION_HOOK__ = (payload) => {
  // let's just print payload
  console.log("hook", payload);
  return payload;
};
```

<figcaption>Listing 1-2: The main Isolation Application script.</figcaption>
</figure>

We need to set up our `tauri.conf.json` configuration to enable Context
Isolation.

### Configuration

Let's assume that our main Frontend `distDir` is set to `../dist`. We also
output the previously created Isolation application to `../dist-isolation`.

Filename: tauri.conf.json

```json
{
  "build": {
    "distDir": "../dist"
  },
  "tauri": {
    "pattern": {
      "use": "isolation",
      "options": {
        "dir": "../dist-isolation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Digging Deeper

If you want to fully understand how the Context Isolation is implemented, so you
can properly secure your application, we go into more detail below.

    participant F as Frontend
    participant H as Isolation Handler
    participant I as Isolation Application
    participant C as Tauri Core

    F-)H: Send Message
    H-)+I: Call the Isolation Application with Message
    I-)-H: Return sanitized Message
    note over H: Automatically encrypt sanitized Message
    H-->>F: Send encrypted, sanitized Message
    F-->>C: Send encrypted, sanitized Message
```

<figcaption>Figure 1-4: Approximate Steps of an IPC Message being sent to Tauri Core with Context
Isolation enabled.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. When `invoke` is called, the Message gets sent to the Isolation Application.
2. Pass the message into the Isolation Application's hook. The Message object
   has been checked to follow the minimum correct shape. <!-- TODO: something about this one is weird, idk -->
3. The return value is used as the new Message. The Isolation Application _may_
   have modified the Message to help sanitize input.
4. The sanitized Message is **automatically** encrypted using AES-GCM using a
   runtime-generated key and sent to the Frontend.
5. The encrypted, sanitized message is sent to Tauri Core; which exclusively
   processes encrypted messages while Context Isolation is enabled.

### Performance Implications

Because encryption of the message does occur, this does mean that there are
additional overhead costs even if the secure Isolation application doesn't do
anything. Most applications should not notice the runtime costs of
encrypting/decrypting the IPC messages as they are both relatively small and
AES-GCM is relatively fast. If you are unfamiliar with AES-GCM, all that is
relative in this context is that it's the only authenticated mode algorithm
included in [SubtleCrypto] and that you probably already use it every day under
the hood with TLS.

There is also a cryptographically secure key generated once each time the Tauri
application is started. It is not generally noticeable if the system already has
enough entropy to immediately return enough random numbers, which is extremely
common for desktop environments. If running in a headless environment to perform
some [end-to-emd testing with WebDriver] then you may want to install some sort
of entropy generating service such as [`haveged`] if your operating system does
not have one included.

> Linux 5.6 (March 2020) now includes entropy generation using speculative
> execution. <!-- TODO: Source? -->

### Limitations

There are a few limitations with Context Isolation due to platform
inconsistencies. The most significant limitation is due to external files not
loading correctly inside sandboxed `iframes` on Windows. Because of this, we
have implemented a simple script inlining step during build time that takes the
content of scripts relative to the Isolation application and injects them
inline. This means that typical bundling or simple including of files like
`<script src="index.js"></script>` still works properly, but newer mechanisms
such as ES Modules will not successfully load.
