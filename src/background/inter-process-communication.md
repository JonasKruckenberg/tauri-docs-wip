# Inter-Process Communication

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) allows isolated processes to
communicate securely and is key to building more complex applications.

Tauri uses a particular style of Inter-Process Communication called
[Asynchronous Message Passing], where processes exchange _requests_
and _responses_ serialized using some simple data representation.
Message Passing should sound familiar to anyone with web development
experience, as this paradigm is used for client-server communication
on the internet.

Message passing is a safer technique than shared memory or direct
function access because the recipient is free to reject or discard
requests as it sees fit. For example, if the Tauri Core process
determines a request to be malicious, it simply discards the requests
and never executes the corresponding function.

In the following, we explain Tauri's two IPC primitives - `Events` and
`Commands` - in more detail.

## Events

Events are fire-and-forget, one-way IPC messages that are best suited
to communicate lifecycle events and state changes. Contrary to
[Commands](#commands) Events can be emitted by both the Frontend _and_
the Tauri Core.

```

## Commands

Tauri also provides a [foreign function interface]-like abstraction on
top IPC messages[^1]. The primary API, `invoke`, is similar to the
browsers `fetch` API and allows the Frontend to invoke rust functions,
pass arguments, and receive data.

Because this mechanism uses the [JSON-RPC] protocol under the hood to
serialize requests and responses, all arguments and return data must
be serializable to JSON.

    F-)+C: IPC request
    note over C: Perform computation, write to file system, etc.
    C-)-F: Response
```

[^1]: Commands still use message passing under the hood, so don't share the same
    security pitfalls as real FFI interfaces.
