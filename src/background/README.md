# Background

Now that you have completed the Quick Start and have a basic Tauri application
at hand, it is tempting to jump right in. We invite you, however, to resist this
temptation for a couple more pages and learn more about the concepts and ideas
behind Tauri. You will find developing an app is much like creating a
traditional client-server application on the web, with a couple of subtle but
important differences.

This chapter will cover Tauris multi-process architecture, windows, and webviews
and our design decisions to make your application more secure and resource
efficient.
