# Building your Application

The Tauri bundler is part of the Tauri CLI and lets you compile your binary, package assets, and
prepare a final bundle with  a single command:

```console
$ tauri build
```

Like the `tauri dev` command, the first time you run this, it takes some time to
collect the Rust crates and build everything - but on subsequent runs, it only
needs to rebuild your app's code, which is much quicker. Besides compiling the
Rust project, the `tauri build` command does several other things for you:

1. **Build the Frontend**

   If you have configured your `tauri.conf.json` correctly, the bundler calls
   the <br> `beforeBuildCommand` during this step, allowing you to build your
   Frontend.

2. **Build the Rust Binary**

   The bundler calls `cargo build` under the hood and compile the Rust project
   into a single executable. This step also _inlines_ your previously generated
   Frontend files into the executable. The compiled executable is placed in the
   `src-tauri/target/release` folder.

3. **Create Packages**

   During this step the bundler collects all necessary files for packaging: the
   binary, [resources], [sidecars], [icons] and app manifests. These files will
   be packaged up according to the package formats your operating system
   supports. The created artifacts are located in the
   `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` folder.

4. **Code Sign**

   If you have code-signing enabled, either for [Windows][windows code signing],
   [macOS][macos code signing], or the [Updater][signing updates], the last step
   is signing the created artifacts. This step will create `.sig` files in the
   `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` for each supported packaging format.

## Packaging Formats

It will detect your operating system and build a bundle accordingly. It
currently supports:

- Windows: `.exe`, `.msi`, `.msi.zip` (updater)
- macOS: `.app`, `.dmg`, `.app.tar.gz` (updater)
- Linux: `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.AppImage.tar.gz` (updater)

## Configuration

There are a number of config options that change how the build process works. For configuring the platform-specific packages, see [Building: Windows Installer], [Building: macOS Bundle], [Building: Linux] and [Building: Updater Artifacts] respectively.

### [`tauri.bundle.active`]

Set to false to disable the bundling process. This will still compile the Rust
project, but not produce any platform-specific packages.

### Resources

Resources are configured by the [`tauri.bundle.resources`] property and are a
convenient way to include files or folders that should not be inlined into the
executable but kept on the filesystem. A common use case is supporting files for
sidecars or images or videos.

## Cross-Platform Compilation

Cross-platform compilation is not supported at this moment. If you want to
produce binaries for all three operating systems, you can use [Virtual Machines]
or a CI service like GitHub Actions.
