Tauri is a toolkit that helps developers make applications for the
major desktop platforms - using virtually any frontend framework in
existence. The core is built with Rust, and the CLI leverages Node.js
making Tauri a genuinely polyglot approach to creating and maintaining
great apps.

Once in a while, we will show you code examples that do not work or do
not compile. In most situations, we lead you to correct solution and
the Rust mascot Ferris will always draw your attention to code that
isn't meant to work:

| Ferris                                                                                                           | Meaning                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

| <img src="img/ferris/should_panic.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris throwing up their hands"/>             | This code panics!                                |
| <img src="img/ferris/not_desired_behavior.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris with one claw up, shrugging"/> | This code does not produce the desired behavior. |
