# Debugging

With all the moving pieces in a Tauri application, chances are you
will not write perfect bug-free code all the time. Your app might
behave weirdly, be very slow, or outright crash.

In this guide, we give you a number of tools and techniques to
troubleshoot problems when they arise.

## Rust

To effectively debug a program, you need to know what's going on
inside. Rust and Tauri provide many tools to make this possible.

### Logging

When your first learned Rust, you might have printed logging messages
by using the `println!` macro:

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("foobar");
}
```

However, for more complex projects, Rust provides an elegant logging
system that allows log messages from app code and dependencies with
different levels, timestamps, and metadata.

To use this system, add the [`log`] crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
log = "0.4"
```

Now you can use a number of logging macros: [`error!`], [`warn!`],
[`info!`], [`debug!`] and [`trace!`] where `error!` represents the
highest-priority log.

```rust,no_run
use log::{trace, debug, info, warn, error};

fn main() {
    trace!("A trace-level message");
    debug!("A debug-level message");
    info!("An info-level message");
    warn!("A warn-level message");
    error!("An error-level message");
}
```

However, you will notice it doesn't actually print anything when you
run this! This is because `log` expects you to bring your own logger.
There are many available implementations to choose from, here are some
of the most popular ones:

- Simple minimal loggers:
  - [`env_logger`]
  - [`simple_logger`]
  - [`simplelog`]
  - [`pretty_env_logger`]
  - [`stderrlog`]
  - [`flexi_logger`]
- Complex configurable frameworks:
  - [`log4rs`]
  - [`fern`]

### [`tauri-plugin-log`]

The Tauri team maintains a logger that is built explicitly for Tauri
applications. It is built on top of [`fern`] and supports writing logs
to many different targets and consuming log messages produced in the
WebView.

Add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
log = "0.4"
tauri-plugin-log = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-log" }
```

and import it like any other Tauri plugin:

<figure>

```rust,no_run
use tauri_plugin_log::{LogTarget, LoggerBuilder};

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(
            LoggerBuilder::new()
                .targets([
                    // write to the OS logs folder
                    LogTarget::LogDir,
                    // write to stdout
                    LogTarget::Stdout,
                    // forward logs to the webview
                    LogTarget::Webview,
                ])
                .build(),
        )
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Tracing

Sometimes simple logs are not enough to debug your problem, though, so
you might reach for the [`tracing`] crate.

In addition to logging-style diagnostics recorded by the [`log`]
crate, it provides information about _temporality_ and _causality_.
Spans in `tracing` are events that have a beginning and end time, may
be entered and exited by the flow of execution, and may exist within a
nested tree of similar spans.

```rust, no_run
use tracing::{info, debug, span, Level};

// records an event outside of any span context:
info!("something happened");

let span = span!(Level::INFO, "my_span");
let _guard = span.enter();

// records an event within "my_span".
debug!("something happened inside my_span");
```

### GDB

The [GNU Project Debugger] (GDB) is a very old program written by
Richard Stallman in 1986. GDB has support for several languages, such
as C/C++, but also modern languages such as Go and Rust.

`rust-gdb` comes with the Rust installation by default and is a
wrapper around GDB that enables pretty-printing rust types in the GDB
output.

To debug a Rust binary, build the binary:

```console
cargo build --debug
```

And then load it into GDB:

```console
rust-gdb target/debug/<app name>
```

### LLDB

[LLDB] is a debugger built on top of [LLVM], the compiler backend used
by Rust itself. We can use the `rust-lldb` tool, which comes with the
Rust installation by default. It wraps [LLDB] to provide
pretty-printing rust types.

To debug a Rust binary, build the binary:

```console
cargo build --debug
```

And then load it into LLDB:

```console
rust-lldb target/debug/<app name>
```

### Panics

When your Rust code runs into a problem that is **so severe** that it
can't recover from it, your program should `panic`. When a [Panic]
occurs, your program will print a failure message, unwind and clean up
the stack, and then quit. A [Panic] will manifest as a hard crash, so
it's crucial to minimize the number of panics.

To determine what caused the [Panic], you can re-run your application
with the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable set to `1` to print a
more detailed failure message.

## JavaScript

To open the WebView dev tools, right-click in the WebView and choose
`Inspect Element`. This opens up the web-inspector similar to the one
you're used to from Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

If you run into problems with your frontend framework, you might reach
for framework-specific dev tools. While many of them are distributed
as _Chromium Extensions_, which are **not** compatible with Tauri,
some of them - such as the [Vue Devtools] - provide standalone
versions that work nicely with Tauri.

### `tauri-plugin-log-api`

As an alternative to the ubiquitous `console.log` debugging,
[`tauri-plugin-log`] offers a JavaScript API that has a very similar
feature set to the Rust version. <br> You can install it from npm with
the following command:

**npm**

```console
npm install --save-dev tauri-plugin-log-api
```

**yarn**

```console
yarn add -D tauri-plugin-log-api
```

**pnpm**

```console
pnpm add -D tauri-plugin-log-api
```

Now you can emit logs using the `trace()`, `debug()`, `info()`,
`warn()` and `error()` functions and attach the devtools console to
the loggers event stream by calling `attachConsole()`:

```javascript
import {
  attachConsole,
  trace,
  debug,
  info,
  warn,
  error,
} from "tauri-plugin-log-api";

// with LogTarget::Webview enabled this function will print logs to the browser console
const detach = await attachConsole();

trace("A trace-level message");
debug("A debug-level message");
info("An info-level message");
warn("A warn-level message");
error("An error-level message");

// detach the webview console from the log stream
detach();
```

Please refer to [the plugin's documentation][`tauri-plugin-log`] for
details.

## Debugging Production Builds

Not all bugs are found during development; some will be reported by
your end-users. Below are some tips to help you debug production
builds.

<!-- TODO: expand -->

### Tauri plugin log

[`tauri-plugin-log`] can be used in production code too. When
configured with the `LogTarget::LogDir` it will write logs to the
canonical log-file directory of your Operating System. When your
application crashes, you can recover logs from those locations, e.g.,
the `Console` application can be used to view log files on macOS:
